# Description
The goal of this data challenge is to study and apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to a real-world regression problem. In this regression problem, each sample corresponds to a researcher (i. e., an author of research papers), and the goal is to build a model that can predict accurately the
h-index of each author.


# Getting started
## Requirements

To install the requirements, run at the root folder:

> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Required files

All the original data files must be located in the same directory as the ___ file.

First, with the code in ___ file you can see the data preprocessing of the data, feature extraction and feature selection.

If you want to save time, our suggestion would be to skip to the ___ file where we build the model, train it, and validate the results.

## Run the model

To execute our model you have to run the file ___.
