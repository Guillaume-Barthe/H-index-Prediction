XML is a new standard for exchanging and representing information on the Internet. Documents can be hierarchically represented by XML-elements. XML documents are represented and indexed using a bitmap indexing technique. We define the similarity and popularity operations available in bitmap indexes and propose a method for partitioning a XML document set. Furthermore, a 2-dimensional bitmap index is extended to a 3dimensional bitmap index, called BitCube. We define statistical measurements in the BitCube: mean, mode, standard derivation, and correlation coefficient. Based on these measurements, we also define the slice, project, and dice operations on a BitCube. BitCube can be manipulated efficiently and improves the performance of document retrieval.\n","7383\n","The paper starts from the observation that in the inclusion-based approach to point-free geometry there are serious difficulties in defining points. These difficulties disappear once we reformulate this approach in the framework of continuous multivalued logic. So, a theory of ‘graded inclusion’ is proposed as a counterpart of the usual ‘crisp inclusion’ of mereology. Again, a second theory is considered in which the graded predicates ‘to be close’ and ‘to be small’ are assumed as primitive. In both cases a suitable notion of abstractive sequence and of equivalence between abstractive sequences enables us to define the points. In the resulting set of points a distance is defined in a natural way and this enables a metrical approach to point-free geometry and therefore to go beyond mereotopology.The general idea is that it is possible to search for mathematical formalizations of the naive theory of the space an ordinary man needs to have in its everyday life. To do this we have to direct our attention not only to regions and the related relation of inclusion as it is usual in point-free geometry, but also to those (vague) properties which are geometrical in nature.\n","14309\n","This contribution describes an approach to integrate a speech understanding and dialog system into a homogeneous architecture based on semantic networks. The definition of the network as well as its use in speech understanding is described briefly. A scoring function for word hypotheses meeting the requirements of a graph search algorithm is presented. The main steps of the linguistic analysis, i.e. syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, are described and their realization in the semantic network is shown. The processing steps alternating between data- and model-driven phases are outlined using an example sentence which demonstrates a tight interaction between word recognition and linguistic processing.\n","15548\n","Cleaneval is a shared task and competitive evaluation on the topic of cleaning arbitrary web pages, with the goal of preparing web data for use as a corpus for linguistic and language technology research and development.

platforms, creating massive and continuous streams of valuable data. While this opened the door for information extraction and mining techniques that can help us understand different aspects of society, extracting useful information from such streams of Web data is far from trivial. In this setting, sentiment analysis techniques can be convenient as they are capable of summarizing general feeling about entities people care about, such as products and companies. Therefore, they can be quite applicable in scenarios like the stock market, which also has tremendous impact on society. This paper describes and evaluates two different techniques for sentiment analysis applied to the Brazilian stock market data: lexicon-based and machine learning based, considering a wide range of text pre-processing and feature selection approaches.\n","**************************************************\n","cleaned:  soil erosion and sediment yield from catchments are key limitations to achieving sustainable land use and maintaining water quality in nature one of the important aspects in protecting the watershed is evaluation of sediment produced by statistical methods controlling sediment loading in protecting the watershed requires knowledge of soil erosion and sedimentation sediment yield is usually not available as a direct measurement but is estimated using geospatial models one of the geospatial models for estimating sediment yield at the basin scale is sediment delivery ratio sdr the present study investigates the spatial sdr model in determining the sediment yield rate considering climate and physical factors of basin in geographic information system environment this new approach was developed and tested on the amammeh catchments in iran the validation of the model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient the developed model is not only conceptually easy and well suited to the local data needs but also requires less parameter which offers less uncertainty in its application while meeting the intended purpose the model is developed based on local data the results predict strong variations in sdr from in to in the uplands of the basin\n","original:  Soil erosion and sediment yield from catchments are key limitations to achieving sustainable land use and maintaining water quality in nature. One of the important aspects in protecting the watershed is evaluation of sediment produced by statistical methods. Controlling sediment loading in protecting the watershed requires knowledge of soil erosion and sedimentation. Sediment yield is usually not available as a direct measurement but is estimated using geospatial models. One of the geospatial models for estimating sediment yield at the basin scale is sediment delivery ratio (SDR). The present study investigates the spatial SDR model in determining the sediment yield rate considering climate and physical factors of basin in geographic information system environment. This new approach was developed and tested on the Amammeh catchments in Iran. The validation of the model was evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient. The developed model is not only conceptually easy and well suited to the local data needs but also requires less parameter, which offers less uncertainty in its application while meeting the intended purpose. The model is developed based on local data. The results predict strong variations in SDR from 0 in to 70 % in the uplands of the Basin.\n","**************************************************\n"]}],"source":["for row in author_text_df.sample(2).itertuples():\n","  print(\"cleaned:\", row[-1])\n","  print(\"original:\", row[-2])\n","  print(\"**************************************************\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eImDZYzTud00"},"source":["#### Merge"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"tGjcRUu1bj9T"},"outputs":[],"source":["author_text_df[\"author\"] = author_text_df[\"author\"] .astype(int)\n","\n","final_all_df = pd.merge(merged_2,author_text_df,how=\"left\",on=['author'])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1638723486984,"user":{"displayName":"Gurami Keretchashvili","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjitSnYJeTw-D6v_AMkopY-4CwOn-htTv6xmILuBA=s64","userId":"08825519430884389009"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"QfPxv35Hblt7","outputId":"951feb5f-3308-4c6d-b1d5-44b95f33c375"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(217801, 18)"]},"execution_count":63,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["final_all_df = final_all_df.drop(columns=['all_concatined_abstract'])\n","final_all_df.shape"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"j8IVYBr-Vd9D"},"source":["## 4.
